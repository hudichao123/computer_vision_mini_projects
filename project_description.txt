There are three projects in this repo.

If you downloaded this repo from github than you WON'T be able to run the python file because some files are too large to be uploaded to github repo.
Instead, you can download the complete repo from
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eR5aStkiTQuj-BeN-eMrLw

I also included the virtual_environment that I used for these projects in case you have a different version of python or Pytorch or numpy...
Downloading could take a while, so please be patient.




Then comes the project description!




The first one is Face_Recognition, using face classifier and eye classifier to detect faces and eyes
from the image and then put rectangle bounding boxes at the detected features.


The second one is Object Detection using pretrained single shot multi-box detection model.
I take short videos as inputs, convert them into frames of images(using openCV),
and then apply ssd to the images and finally put rectangle bounding boxes at the detected features.
The several .mp4 files are inputs and outputs. And it seems that ssd is performing really well if the
objects are not overlapping.



The third one is about training a deep convolutional generative adversarial network(GANS) for image generation using pytorch.
I built up the generator with  deconvolution layers(100->512->256->128->64->3), RELU layers, Batchnorm layers(100->512->256->128->64->3) and one output tanh layer.
And the discrminator is build up with convolution layers (3->64->128->256->512->1), LEAKY RELU layers, Batchnorm layers(3->64->128->256->512->1) and one output sigmoid layer.
Finally I stored the output of the model at the end of each epoch (25 epoches in all) in the results/ folder.
Obviously this model is doing really well on generating image just after the first several epoches.
